        <h4>Confidential mobile application</h4>
        <p>
        Project created during my internship at DMDC.</br>
        It involved developing their patient portal as a cross-platform app for use on iOS, Android, and the web.</br>
        I took on the role of lead developer for the project, despite having no prior deep experience and without the ability to receive assistance from colleagues.</br>
        The project was built using Kotlin, Flutter, and Dart.</br>
        All documentation and planning were also carried out by me.</br>
        The profect has biometric security, checks and registers current language and compatible for multiple devices.</br>
        At this time, the code is not publicly available.
